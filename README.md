  DNA methylation is an important heritable epigenetic mark that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and the pathogenesis of various human disorders. The commonly used DNA methylation measurement approaches, e.g., llumina Infinium HumanMethylat.ion-27 and -450 BeadChip arrays (27K and 450K arrays) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), only cover a small proportion of the total CpG sites in the human genome, which considerably limited the scope of the genome-DNA methylation analysis.  We proposed a new computational strategy to impute the methylation value at the unmeasured CpG sites using the mixture of regression model (MRM) of radial basis functions (RBFs), integrating information of neighboring CpGs and the similarities in local methylation patterns across subjects and across multiple genomic regions. 

  The in-house R script used for data analysis of our manuscript titled ‘A Novel Computational Strategy for DNA Methylation Imputation Using Mixture Regression Model (MRM)’ is shared in this repository.
